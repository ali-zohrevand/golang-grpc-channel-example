# Go Applications with Goroutines and gRPC Communication

This document provides a simplified overview of two Go applications, Application A and Application B, which demonstrate the use of goroutines and gRPC communication.

## Application A

- **Function 1 (Goroutine):**
  - Listens for messages on a channel and adds "hello" to the received message.
  - Sends the modified message to Application B via gRPC.
- **Function 2 (Goroutine):**
  - Listens for incoming gRPC messages.
  - Writes received messages to a channel shared with Function 1.
- Application A's gRPC server is hosted on port 50051.

## Application B

- **Function 1 (Goroutine):**
  - Reads messages from a channel.
  - Appends the messages to a text file.
  - Sends the current time as a response to Application A via gRPC.
- **Function 2 (Goroutine):**
  - Listens for incoming gRPC messages.
  - Writes the content of received messages to a channel shared with Function 1.
- Application B's gRPC server is hosted on port 50052.

These applications serve as practical examples of using goroutines for concurrent execution and gRPC for inter-process communication in Go, making them useful for building distributed systems.

Please note that you should define the gRPC service and generate corresponding client code using `protoc` and your `.proto` file for both applications. Also, ensure you add error handling and proper context handling in production code.
